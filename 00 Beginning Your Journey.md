<h1 id="beginning-your-journey">Beginning Your Journey</h1>
<p>Getting started in computer programming can be intimidating. There is so much technical jargon, walls of indecipherable code, and many concepts totally alien to daily life.</p>
<p>Before getting started, let’s frame things in a way that will make everything easier to understand, using a bit of imagination.</p>
<h2 id="story-your-mission-should-you-choose-to-accept-it">Story: Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It</h2>
<p><em>Congratulations! You have been selected as a member of an elite team. This team will be setting up remote colonies to explore and develop Mars.</em></p>
<p><em>Your have been assigned to control a highly advanced and fully customizable robot. Your robot lives in a special pod, which is stocked with shelves and shelves of premade components that you can add or remove from your robot, depending on the needs of each tasks. In addition, the pod has a workbench with all of the tools and raw materials you need to craft your own components and modify existing components to best suit your needs.</em></p>
<p><em>You will control all of this remotely from your computer. In the next lesson we will help you set up all of the software you need to control your robot.</em></p>
<p>Before we begin, its important to have an idea of what to expect when learning to Code in general, and when learning Java in particular.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p>Learning anything new is challenging. Learning computer programming requires learning a few things at once.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard Beginnings</strong><br>
Learning something new is always hard. The beginning is especially frustrating, because you lack the knowledge and skills and will fail a lot. This is true with learning anything, and coding is no different. You have to embrace that initial period when things are hard and confusing. If you keep at it and work hard, soon everything will start to click and will get easier and easier.</li>
<li><strong>Learning a New Language</strong><br>
In order to learn how to code, you need to learn a computer language. Like learning any new language, it takes time. The more you immerse yourself in a new language, the sooner you will become familiar and even fluent. It is best to do a little every day, and over weeks and months the new language will become second nature. Despite what some language learning products claim, there is no “fast” way to learn a new language. Your mastery will only come from continuous exposure and use over time.</li>
<li><strong>Creating New Things</strong><br>
When you code, you will be creating new programs. You need to enjoy the process of creating something new, testing your creation, and improving it over time.</li>
<li><strong>Problem Solving</strong><br>
One of most important skills in coding is problem solving. You need to take real world problems and create programs to help solve those problems. You also need to constantly debug your code. It is important to enjoy finding a problem and finding a solution. When something doesn’t work you need to break it down into small bits, and try to solve them.</li>
<li><strong>Learning From Others</strong><br>
The world of coding is vast, and is constantly growing and evolving. No one can know everything. Therefore, one of the most important skills is to be comfortable looking for information, answers, and advice. Today, this search for information mostly happens online. So get in the habit of looking things up.</li>
<li><strong>Just Do It!</strong><br>
Don’t be afraid to just jump in and try it out!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike Boyd Learns New Things</strong><br>
Mike Boyd is a YouTube creator who learns new skills fast. He measures exactly how many hours and minutes it takes him to learn each skill, and videos his progress from start to finish.</p>
<p>One of the great lessons from these videos, is that it really highlights the initial frustration period of each new skill. Yet, it also shows how few hour of focused practice it really takes to master the basics of a new skill.</p>
<p>He also explains why he doesn’t use a lot of tutorials—information overload.</p>
<p>It’s often better to just jump in and start <em>doing</em> before collecting information. After you have some basic experience, the information will help and make more sense.</p>
<p>Here is a nice article about the most important skill for mastering programming—perseverance!<br>
