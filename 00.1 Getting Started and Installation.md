<h1 id="getting-started">01 Getting Started</h1>
<p>One of trickiest parts of getting started with programming in a language like Java is the setup and installation. You need a collection of programs installed and configured properly on your computer. When these are all setup properly, you have a “development environment” (or “dev” environment) that allows you to create Java programs.</p>
<h2 id="jumping-straight-in">Jumping Straight In</h2>
<p>If you just want to try Java out and learn the basics of the language without any setup, you can do that with online compilers and online tutorial applications.</p>
<p>Online Java Compilers will let you write, test, and run snippets of code. Great for quick practice or demonstrating small bits of code. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CompileJava</strong> <a href="https://www.compilejava.net/">https://www.compilejava.net/</a></li>
<li><strong>TutorialPoint</strong> <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php</a></li>
<li><strong>Browxy</strong> <a href="https://www.beta.browxy.com/">https://www.beta.browxy.com/</a>  (This is an updated version. For the old version go to: <a href="http://browxy.com/">http://browxy.com/</a> )</li>
</ul>
<p>Online tutorials are a great way to start learning the basic syntax of Java or any new language. Here are a few to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solo Learn</strong> <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">https://www.sololearn.com/</a><br>
Solo Learn is my top pick for learning basics like syntax. It is completely free, and has a mobile app, so you can learn and practice on the go.</li>
<li><strong>Code Academy</strong> <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">https://www.codecademy.com/</a><br>
Code Academy has lots of great content complete with practice challenges. However, you need to pay for a lot of their content, and they don’t have a mobile app version.</li>
<li><strong>Learn Java</strong> <a href="https://www.learnjavaonline.org/">https://www.learnjavaonline.org/</a><br>
Learn Java is a free online site dedicated to teaching the basics of Java. It is bare-bones site, but its free and it gets the job done. It even includes some practice challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="jumping-in-the-deep-end">Jumping in the Deep End</h2>
<p>Although learning and practicing online is quick and easy, it will only get you so far. (See this article for example: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-reasons-shouldnt-learn-code-codeacademy/">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-reasons-shouldnt-learn-code-codeacademy/</a> .)</p>
<p>To really learn how to create programs—and to prepare you for doing more complex projects in the future—you need to jump in the deep end and set up your own dev environment and create real applications. This is much more complicated than an online tutorial, but allows you to learn many vital skills that you’ll need as a programmer. For this course we’ll install and setup all of the programs you need. The good news is that once you’re done you’ll be set up for just about anything you’ll want to code in the future!</p>
<h2 id="installing-java">Installing Java</h2>
<p>The first thing you will need to do is install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). Java is constantly putting out new versions of the language with small changes and updates. Currently they are up to version 11, and they now put out an update every 6 months.</p>
<p>The JDK is a special package of software for Java developers. You need this to create new Java programs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To run a Java program on your machine, you also need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In the past, this was a separate download, but now comes bundled with the JDK. (You likely already have the JRE installed on your computer anyway).</p>
<p><strong>Important—Get Used to Googling!</strong><br>
Although I will do my best to provide step-by-step instructions, I recommend using Google to search for instructions and downloads. Things change very quickly in the digital world. Websites are often changed, making links obsolete. In addition, technologies are updated or replaced quickly. In fact, I have almost never found a book or online tutorial that can be followed step-by-step and work out of the box! Sometimes this is due to a mistake, but very often the technology has changed. A perfectly good tutorial will usually become partially obsolete in a few months to a year.</p>
<p>Even software for programmers often doesn’t work out of the box! A lot of dev environment software needs updating or manual configuration to work properly, because they rely on so many other software packages that are constantly changing. Don’t be surprised if things don’t run as expected when installed without some googling and fixing.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the most important skills a programmer needs today is to be comfortable searching online for information and solutions. Don’t be afraid when something doesn’t work. It may be frustrating, but just google it and fix it. The more comfortable you become finding and following instructions, the easier it will be to develop software. A friend of mine that works in software development told me, “A programmer is a paid googler.” Throughout this course, I will try to recommend that you google things yourself, and only use my links and instructions as a backup.</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-step Guide</h3>
<p>If you want to follow along with a video, search for something like, “<em>how to install java jdk 11 in windows 10</em>”. Here is a video that I found that walks you through the process: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZbHHLobt8A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZbHHLobt8A</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Download and run:</strong> Let’s start by navigating to the download page for Java by googling something like “<em>java jdk download</em>”. After finding and downloading the software, run the file to begin installation.</p>
<p>If you have trouble finding it try <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" title="Java JDK Download Page">this link</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Your Java Version</strong> Google something like “<em>checking java jdk version</em>” and follow the instructions. (For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS88XH_1.6.0/iva/install_mils_windows_java.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>You should find something like this: Open the Command Prompt, by typing <code>cmd</code> in the Windows Search Bar. (You may need to run this as an Administrator.) This will open a black box with an old DOS style command line program. Type <code>java -version</code>. If Java is installed correctly you will see something like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>C:\Users\Admin&gt;java -version
java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
</code></pre>
<p>If the version number displayed is not what you installed, or you get an error, you probably need to edit your “Environment Variables”. This means that you need to manually tell you computer which version of Java to use, and where to find it.</p>
<p>(Annoying isn’t it? It seems like no one bothers making software for programmers user-friendly, because they just assume you will do things yourself. This may be good for advanced users who want to customize all of their settings manually, but it makes it hard for new programmers to get set up and started.)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Update Your Environment Variables</strong> If Java didn’t install properly, google something like “<em>java environment variables windows 10</em>”</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the path to your Java JDK.
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your JDK “<em>bin</em>” directory. Mine is at: <strong>Windows(C:)&gt;Program Files&gt;Java&gt;jdk-11.0.1&gt;bin</strong> but your version may have a different number, so navigate to your directory.</li>
<li>Click on your Windows Explorer bar that shows your current directory. It should turn blue, and change to show the path. Copy this path with <strong>Ctrl+C</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Advanced System Settings by pressing <strong>Windows Key + Pause</strong> (in Windows 10) or typing “<em>advanced system settings</em>” in the Windows Search Bar. Alternatively, you can open Windows Explorer, right click on <strong>This PC</strong> select <strong>properties</strong> and click on the link for Advanced system settings in the top left.</li>
<li>This will open a new box. Toward the bottom of this box, click <strong>Environment Variables</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>System Variables</strong> pane, scroll down to find <strong>Path</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Path</strong> and click <strong>edit</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>New</strong> and paste the path to your Java JDK with <strong>Ctrl+V</strong></li>
<li>If there are any old Java paths, delete them</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> in each of the (3) open settings windows to close them and save your settings</li>
<li>Now recheck your Java version (you may have to close and reopen your Command Prompt to get the updated version</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installing-an-ide">Installing an IDE</h2>
<p>Once you have the correct version of Java installed properly, you are ready to install your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is the program you will use to write and organize your Java code.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-and-ide">Choosing and IDE</h3>
<p>There are many options for your dev environment. The three most popular IDEs are all free and offer a lot of great features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NetBeans</strong>    <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/">https://netbeans.apache.org/</a></li>
<li><strong>Eclipse</strong> <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">https://www.eclipse.org/ide/</a></li>
<li><strong>IntelliJ</strong> <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For this course I will be using IntelliJ. I recommend this choice, because Java is now used very heavily in Android development, and Google’s IDE for android (Android Studios) is based on IntelliJ. By using IntelliJ now, it will be very easy for you to apply your Java skills to Android development. Also, IntelliJ is the most popular IDE for Java, and has the most advanced tools, while the other IDEs seem to be falling behind. Just a few years ago, any of these IDEs would have been about an equal choice, but today I recommend going with IntelliJ.</p>
<p>(If you choose to use a different IDE, all of the core Java code will work the same. Just know that the file structure and shortcuts may be different than those explained in this course.)</p>
<h3 id="installing-intellij">Installing IntelliJ</h3>
<p>Navigate to the IntelliJ download page by searching for <em>“IntelliJ Download”</em> or navigating to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a> . (JetBrains are the makers of IntelliJ.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Download</strong> button, which will redirect you to the<br>
download page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Choose the Community version on the right, by clicking the<br>
<strong>Download</strong> button under this option. (Use the default .exe option for easy installation.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the file in your downloads folder (or wherever you’d like).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the file finishes downloading, double click on it. This will start an Installer. Follow the prompts to complete your installation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations! Your dev environment is now all set to go. You are ready to begin coding in Java.</p>
